## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
 - It was interesting seeing what could be common to super learners.
 - I already read a lot and take good care of my brain.
 - I would like to work on the process and growth mindset.
 - Could add time to decompress in addition to just the short breaks often.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  - Hash Tag `#`
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  - An integer is a whole number while a float has decimal places
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  - `animal = "zebra"`
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
  - `puts animal`
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  - Interpolation is using the variable inside of another data type
  - `puts "The #{animal} has stripes."`
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
  - `gets.chomp`
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
